# MOESI Final Project  [By: Herbert Aruya]

For this project I was to create a cache simulator that uses a MOESI Invalidation protocol. Follor user interface generated by program to specify types of processors.

This repository contains: 
  - Source Code w/ Makefile (compilation/testing explained below)
  - Documentation (project report)

# HOW TO COMPILE AND TEST
> REMARK: This program was compiled and tested on a linux based machine using the g++ compiler

Compilation: Type "make all" in terminal to initially compile the program (optional)

Testing: To test the program with tests files (.tr) run the command make run; For this to work all the .tr files need to be in the test_files directory or this command will not work

You can specify test files manually by compiling the program by itself (using make all command) and specifying .tr test files as arguments to program in the command line.
